# Atrial-Fibrillation-Detection-from-ECG-via-Machine-Learning-Methods

## Description of the project
Given a labeled dataset, whose data is electrocardiographs with four types of labels, we are asked to create an automated method to classify each electrocardiogram. The labels are normal heart rate, atrial brillation, other type of heart rate and noisy electrocardiogram. The noisy electrocardiographs were not used in this project. The data used for this project is taken from [The PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/).

## How to run the project
1. Download the electrocardiographs data from [The PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/).
2. Install the the libraries numpy, sklearn, heartpy by opening the terminal and executing the command $pip3 install numpy sklearn heartpy
3. Change the path for the

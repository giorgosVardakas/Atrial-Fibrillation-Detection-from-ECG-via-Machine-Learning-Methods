# Atrial-Fibrillation-Detection-from-ECG-via-Machine-Learning-Methods

## Description of the project
Given a labeled dataset, whose data is electrocardiographs with four types of labels, we are asked to create an automated method to classify each electrocardiogram. The labels are normal heart rate, atrial brillation, other type of heart rate and noisy electrocardiogram. The noisy electrocardiographs were not used in this project. The data used for this project is taken from [The PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/).
